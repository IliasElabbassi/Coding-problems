Daily Coding Problem, solving

```
You can run most of the files with node.js
```

- **fastest_power.js** :
    Calculate the interfer exponentiation in a faster way than the naive one ( i.e multiplication repetition)

- **remove_null_leaf_tree.js (p5.js)** :
    Remove all leafs with the value of zero in a tree
    
- **goldbacks_conjecture.js** : we take an input (>= 2), and we give two prime number that sums up to the input

- **balanced_parentheses.js** : take a string as input, which only contains '(' , ')' and ' * '. The character ' * ' can represent either a '(' or ')' . And it return a status that state if the input is balanced or not.

- **fibonacci_sequence_linear.js** : return the n-th value in the fibonacci in O(1) complexity
